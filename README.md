# key-manager
SSH keys manager for Windows 11 

Windows ssh recognizes just one key called "id_ed25515", so if you have more keys (for example more github projects) you become crazy.
With this project all your keys are stored in a subfolder of .ssh folder and by executing the program you can easily switch between them! ðŸ¥³

If required, change the path of the .ssh folder of your system in the python file.

If you want to add this program to the path as "g++" command:
  Change the path of the python file and the python interpreter in the .cpp file (python must be 3.10 or higher, to use the "match" statement);
  Compile .cpp file and add it to path.
