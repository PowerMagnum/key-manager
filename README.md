# key-manager
SSH keys manager for Windows 11 

Windows ssh recognize just one key called "id_ed25515", so if you have most keys (for example liked to more github project) you become crazy.
With this project all your keys are stored in a subfolder of .ssh folder and executing the program you can easily switch its! 🥳

USAGE:

If is required change the path of .ssh folder of your system in the python file.

If you want to add this program to the path like "g++" command:
  Change the path of the python file and the python interpreter in the .cpp file (python must be 3.10 or higher, to use the "match" statement);
  Compile .cpp file and add it to path.
